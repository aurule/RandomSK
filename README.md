# RandomSK

*Requirements:* Python 2.7, GTK 3, pygtk

RandomSK started as a simple program to generate Seeming & Kith pairs for use with White Wolf's *Changeling: the Lost* game system. It has since been extended to generate type and subtype pairs for other publications in White Wolf's *New World of Darkness* line of games.

**Supported Game Lines**:
* *Changeling: the Lost*, core book kiths only
* *Werewolf: the Forsaken*, both Pure and Forsaken tribes
* *Mage: the Awakening*

## Compatability

RandomSK requires python 2.7, GTK 3.0+, and the PyGObject package. Once these are installed, it should easily launch from your file browser of choice. It has only been tested in Linux, however.

## Future Plans

More game lines are always on the table as the need arises. If there's one you'd like to see sooner than later, open an enhancement issue for it.

I may eventually include honor groups (Werewolf Lodges and sub-lodges, Mage Legacies, Changeling Entitlements, etc.), but I prefer to pick and choose who is in what honor group, rather than have it randomized. If it would help your own game, though, throw an issue at it and I'll get to work :p
